     <h3>An art gallery is a place where creativity comes alive,
        <br. offering a window into the imagination of artists from different cultures and time periods. 
        <br>
        Each piece of artwork tells its own story—whether through colors, textures, or forms—and invites viewers to experience emotions,
        <br> ideas, and perspectives beyond their own. A gallery is not just about displaying paintings or sculptures;
        <br> it is about celebrating human expression, preserving history, and inspiring future generations. 
        <br>Walking through an art gallery feels like taking a journey where every corner reveals a new world of beauty, thought, and inspiration.
